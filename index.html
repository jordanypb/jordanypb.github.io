<p>I was born in Chicago. My parents were born in Nigeria. I am 15 years old. I like to play basketball. My favorite Nigerian food is Jollof rice and my favorite American food is Fried Chicken.</p>
<p>I have 3 siblings: Joshua, Alexandria, and Jacob. Jacob is my younger brother who is 10 years old. Alexandria is my older sister who is 19 years old. Joshua is my older brother who is 22 years old. I enjoy family time especially with my older brother and sister since i dont get to see them as often because they are in college. They go to school at <a href="https://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign</a>  I go to <a href="https://www.gemschicago.org/en/">GEMS World Academy </a>in Chicago, IL. I am currently doing a project doing a project in my computer science class where I have to create a website about myself.</p>
